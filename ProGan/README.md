# ProGAN
This Jupyter notebook is an implementation of ProGAN paperin PyTorch.</br>
Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lamsimon/celebahq</br>
Some utility functions are borrowed from https://github.com/aladdinpersson/Machine-Learning-Collection/tree/master/ML/Pytorch/GANs/ProGAN whereas the Generator and Discriminator are self written.</br>
Training has been done till image size 512 and with latent vector of size 256</br>
Training has been done for 5 days and using "mps" instead of "cuda"</br>
I guess results are pretty good but has the potential to improve further if trained for more days with latent vector of 512.</br>
